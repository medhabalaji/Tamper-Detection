## Anti-Tampering IoT Kit for Weighing and Measuring Devices
A collaborative ESP32-based project submitted for the **Smart India Hackathon 2025**.  
This system detects tampering using light, vibration, and magnetic field changes, and sends real-time alerts via a Blynk IoT dashboard.

## Hardware Used
. ESP32 Dev Board  
. LDR Sensor  
. MPU6050 Accelerometer  
. Reed Switch (LM393 module)  
. Active Buzzer  
. LEDs  
. WiFi connectivity via ESP32  
. Blynk dashboard for remote monitoring

## Features
. **LDR Sensor**: Detects sudden light changes (e.g. lid opened)  
. **MPU6050**: Detects vibration or impact, even slight movement  
. **Reed Switch**: Detects magnetic tampering (lid displacement)  
. **Buzzer**: Activates on any intrusion event  
. **LEDs**: Visual feedback for LDR and MPU6050 triggers  
. **Blynk Dashboard**: Displays sensor data and intrusion alerts in real time
